Stack File

Node.h, Node.cpp, SingleLinkedList.h, SingleLinkedList.cpp, Stack.h, Stack.cpp, main.cpp, Makefile, README.txt are all of the documents for the search file.

This program takes the values inserted into the program and creates a stack data structure upon the users choice of values.  I have hard coded the values into the program but they could have been easily done by utilizing the commandline arguments or by prompting the user to enter certain valid values within range.

I utilized the Sublime text editor and the Ubunta Commandline in order to compile this program by methods of creating a Makefile.  In order to compile this program correctly, then all of the files have to be copied into their own directory which I called mine "Stack".  After this is done, then you have to make the "LIFO" executable file by typing <make> into the commandline.  Then by looking at the "Stack" directory, you should have a "LIFO" executable file which usually appears as a bright yellow directory.  In order to run this you must type  </.LIFO> and then <enter> into the commandline.  In order to clean the file or to re-make the file, then you must type <make clean> in the same Stack directory. This should clean the file for a new rebuild.  

Enclosed in "double-quotation marks" indicates a file or directory name.
Enclosed in <arrow operators tag structure> indicates buttons needed to be pressed by programmer or end-user.

Test Data utilized for Push function was: 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55.
Test Data utilized for Pop function was: 55, 45, 35.
Test Data utilized for Peek function was: 25.

Even though these are the data that I utilized for my compilation, any valid data range should and could be utilized.
